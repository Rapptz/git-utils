## Git Utilities

A bunch of extra utilities to help me work with git easier. These are typically implemented in
either Python or sh.

## Requirements

This technically requires `sh.exe` on Windows. All git installations come with this, so it shouldn't be
a big issue. This also requires Python 2.7+.
